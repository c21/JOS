# JOS
This repo is my source code and note for [MIT 6.828 Operating System Engineering](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2014).  All solution here should pass **make grade** check. I finished the labs in one month just for fun, and I [learned a lot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c21/JOS/master/note) :)
